Installation:

## Local
- become non-root user (strongly recommended), here as example: vdr

- download & extract package into a directory
    # su - vdr
    $ wget https://github.com/pbiering/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng/archive/master.zip
    $ unzip master.zip
    $ cd tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-master

- create as root the folder /etc/opt/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng and change permission
    # mkdir -p /etc/opt/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng
    # chown vdr /etc/opt/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng

- copy & adjust config file: /etc/opt/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng/users.conf
    $ cp etc-opt-tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-users.conf.example /etc/opt/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng/users.conf
    don't forget to set at least user/pass/folder

- list confgured users:
    $ ./tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-wrapper.sh -l
INFO  : list users
INFO  : List entry: USER:PASS


## TVinfo
- create TVinfo account (if not already existing)
   in case of empty 'Sender' (stations) or 'Merkzettel' (schedules) below contact TVinfo support to trigger enabling in their backend

- check that your TVinfo 'Merkzettel' at least contains one entry


## TVinfo+Local
- check channel mapping (TVinfo->VDR)
    $ ./tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-wrapper.sh -c -N -u USER
    => adjust 'Meine Sender' for proper matching (goal is delta=0)


## Local
- check download of 'Merkzettel' in dry-run mode (-N)
    $ ./tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-wrapper.sh -N -u USER
    => if script reports that at least one timer must be added to VDR, everything is looking well

- run script without dry-run
    $ ./tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-wrapper.sh -u USER
    => timers should be created

- re-run script without dry-run should result in following output:
    $ ./tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-wrapper.sh -u USER
INFO  : selected user: USER
INFO  : run tvinfomerk2vdr-ng with username: USER (folder:FOLDER)
INFO  : Fetch 'Sender' via XML interface
INFO  : XML 'Sender' has entries: 181
INFO  : MeineSender amount (summary): 64
INFO  : AlleSender amount (cross-check summary): 64 (delta=0 [should be 0] nomatch=117 [station not existing in VDR])
INFO  : Fetch 'Merkzettel' via XML interface
INFO  : XML 'Merkliste' has entries: 24
INFO  : No existing timers need to be removed
INFO  : No new timers need to be added

- finally create a cron job (crontab -e) with following contents
@reboot cd $HOME/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-master/ && $HOME/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-master/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-wrapper.sh 2>&1
15 0-23/2 * * * cd $HOME/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-master/ && $HOME/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-master/tvinfomerk2vdr-ng-wrapper.sh 2>&1

    => output is usually sent via e-mail, so it is recommended that
     a) change cron output to log file
     b) enable sending of e-mail by configuration of local mailserver and related forward entries
